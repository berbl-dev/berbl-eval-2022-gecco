# Analysis of the runs conducted for the 2022 GECCO paper


This assumes that the corresponding experiments have been run and their results
stored in `path/to/results/mlruns`. See the [the berbl-exp-2022-gecco
repository](https://github.com/berbl-dev/berbl-exp-2022-gecco).


1. Install
   [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/installing-binary.html)
   [including flakes support](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) in order to be
   able to run `nix develop` later.  Note that [Nix does not yet support
   Windows](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/supported-platforms.html).
2. Clone the repository (`git clone â€¦`). Run the next steps from within the
   cloned repository.
3. Enter a shell that contains all dependencies by running
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```
   (may take some time to complete).
4. Run the evaluation, pointing it to the `mlruns` directory containing the
   experiment results.
   ```bash
   python eval.py path/to/results/mlruns
   ```
5. Run the evaluation of the parameter study, pointing it to the `mlruns-ps`
   directory containing the experiment results.
   ```bash
   python eval.py path/to/results/mlruns-ps
   ```


Note: Some evaluation data is printed to `stdout`, some is stored in `eval`.
